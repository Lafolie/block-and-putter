# Block and Putter

Block & Putter enables players to design and play their own golf courses in Minecraft.

# Notes

* Players can build their own courses/holes
* Players track their own scores (at least for now)
* The mod provides 2 new kinds of grassy block: fairway, and putting green
* Regular grass blocks count as 'rough'
* Sand & water are bunker & water hazards
* All other blocks are considered something (some kinda super rough?)
* Use tags to dictate these properties
* Balls can be placed onto a tee (forgot to mention the tee item in the above post)
* Using a club on a ball flings it in the direction the player is aiming
* For now clubs have a set power, but once things are working could have a metre mechanic similar to traditional golf computer games
* Putters incur a much more lower velocity, especially on the Y-axis
* If a ball rolls onto the hole portion of the Green Hole Block (or whatever) it goes into its inventory to be collected (can play a sound/particles or whatever)
* Eventually add things like wedges, hole flags, maybe a special container like a golf bag that can hold clubs, balls, and tees
Other future stuff could include something like a lawn mower that changes grass into fairway / green
* A scorecard
* A trophy haha
* Clubs made of different materials (wood/stone/iron/gold/etc)
